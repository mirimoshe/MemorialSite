## project description 💻
In this project, I used **C#** with **.NET** for building a robust server-side application, utilizing **ASP.NET Web API** for creating **RESTful** services. I implemented a layered architecture to separate concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. **Entity Framework** was used for efficient database access, allowing interaction with records as C# objects. Additionally, I employed **dependency injection** to manage dependencies and middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like logging and authentication.
