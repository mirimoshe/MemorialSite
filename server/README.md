# Memorial site - server

## project description üíª
In this project, I used **C#** with **.NET** for building a robust server-side application, utilizing **ASP.NET Web API** for creating **RESTful** services. I implemented a layered architecture to separate concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. **Entity Framework** was used for efficient database access, allowing interaction with records as C# objects. Additionally, I employed **dependency injection** to manage dependencies and middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like logging and authentication.

## Technologies ‚öôÔ∏è
-**C#**: With 5 years of experience, C# is my first programming language. I chose it for its strong typing and object-oriented features.                          
-**.NET**: I have 1 year of experience using the .NET framework, which provides a comprehensive platform for developing scalable and high-performance applications.          
-**Web API**: I have 1 year of experience with ASP.NET Web API, which allows me to create RESTful services easily using HTTP communication with the client side.   
-**RESTful API**: I have developed APIs in multiple languages, focusing on REST principles to ensure clear and efficient resource access.                     
-**JWT**: I have utilized JWT in various projects over the past year for secure authentication and authorization. This technology enhances security by encoding user information in a token.                                                                                    
-**Entity Framework**: I use Entity Framework for data access, which simplifies interactions with databases by allowing me to work with data as C# objects.      
-**SQL**: I have 2 years of experience with SQL database language, which is easy to use for managing and querying data.                                  
-**Dependency Injection**: I implement dependency injection to manage dependencies effectively within my applications, making the code more maintainable.
